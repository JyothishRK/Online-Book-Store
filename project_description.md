##Project Description:
The Online Bookstore project simulates an online bookstore where users can browse and purchase books. The system utilizes object-oriented principles to model the bookstore's components, multithreading for concurrent operations, and concurrency for handling multiple user requests simultaneously.

##Project Goal:
The goal of the Online book store is to create a functional and user-friendly e-commerce platform for selling books online using Java. The system provides a seemless experience for users to browse, search and purchase books, manage their profile and interact with the book catalogue.
